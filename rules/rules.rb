Getting out to the frontier may have been a struggle, but out in them asteroids it gets real sketchy. Insurance can save you when disaster strikes, and believe me it will. They'll tow your ship's bits in to get patched up, but not your cargo... So keep your eyes open when chasin' them big scores.

  example <<-EXAMPLE
David places one of his crew disks on the first asteroid space. He rolls a 4, which beats the 2 on the asteroid. He draws one resource card for his one mining card.

Susan places one crew disk on the next asteroid space. She rolls a 3, which only ties the 3 on the asteroid. Armor may have added to her roll, but she has none and crashes. She places her remaining crew disk on the next available action circle and discards her resources. She will have to wait until next round to take further actions.

Morgan draws three contracts and places a crew disk on the contract pile. He draws 'Copper + Silver', 'Two Gold', and 'Three Silver'.

  example <<-EXAMPLE
Morgan has resources in hand which he hopes to use to fulfill his valuable Three Silver reserved contract. He sees the asteroids have grown risky late in the round. Since he does not want to spend or risk these resources nor take another unfulfilled contract, he passes by placing his remaining crew disks on to an empty Lounge action circle and hopes that his caution will pay off.

  example <<-EXAMPLE
David decides to upgrade his Mining ability. He has his initial mining upgrade, so he must pay the second cost of 2. He pays a silver from his hand, takes a Mining card and places a crew disk. He will draw one additional resource when succeeding on asteroids for the rest of the game and no one else may upgrade mining this round.

Susan decides to play it safe after crashing and upgrade Armor. The first Armor only costs 1, but the cheapest resource she has is a silver. She decides to pay this, losing the change, takes an Armor card and places a crew disk. She will add one to her die rolls for the rest of the game and no one else may upgrade mining this round.

Teresa also decides to upgrade, but Armor and Mining are taken so Crew is her only option. With two starting Crew, she must pay the third cost of 4. She pays a gold and a copper together, takes a Crew card and places a crew disk. She will have this extra crew disk to use for the rest of the game and no one else may upgrade crew this round.
