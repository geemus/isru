It was only a matter of time before somebody figured out how to snatch up them resources that were floating about. Just don't be fooled into think'n they figured how to do safe like. Risk comes with reward though, least til MegaCorp buys up the rights... Best strike while the iron's hot, welcome to the asteroids!

Getting yourself out to the frontier may have been a struggle, but out in the asteroids it gets real sketchy. Insurance comes to the rescue when disaster strikes and believe me, it will. They'll tow your ship's bits in to get patched up, but not your cargo... So keep your eyes open, but don't be too scared to chase them big scores.

  example <<-EXAMPLE
David got the platinum, so he will go first. He decides to mine and places one of his crew disks on the first asteroid space, which has the number 2. He rolls a 4, which beats the number. Since he has one mining upgrade, he draws one resource card and ends his turn.

Susan got gold and so she will go second. She also decides to mine and places one crew disk on the next asteroid space, which has the number 3. She rolls a 3, which does not beat the number. Armor would add one to her roll for each upgrade, but she has none. She crashes, placing her remaining crew disk on the next available spot and discarding her gold. This ends her turn and she will have to wait to reclaim her crew disks during <i>Refresh</i> before she will be able to take additional actions.

  example <<-EXAMPLE
Morgan chooses to draws three contracts and places a crew disk on the contract pile. He draws <i>CS</i>, <i>GG</i>, and <i>SSS</i>. He decides that since it is still early in the game, he keeps <i>SSS</i> as it is worth the most points if he can complete it. He decides not take too many contracts at once though, so he discards <i>CS</i> and <i>GG</i>.

Teresa would like to draw more contracts also, but must wait until the following turn when contracts are once again available. When her turn comes up she draws three contracts and places a crew disk. She draws <i>CS</i>, <i>CS</i> and <i>GG</i>. She keeps one <i>CS</i> and discards the other <i>CS</i> and the <i>GG</i>.

Teresa previously drew <i>SG</i> from the discarded contracts. As she has both <i>Silver</i> and <i>Gold</i>, she chooses to fulfill this contract with her next action.

  example <<-EXAMPLE
Morgan has resources in hand which he hopes to use to fulfill his valuable Three Silver reserved contract. He sees that the asteroids are nearly full late in the round after several actions. Since he does not want to spend or risk these resources and does not want to take another unfulfilled contract, he instead passes his remaining actions by placing his crew disks on the Lounge and hoping that next turn his caution will pay off.

David decides to upgrade his Mining ability. Since he already has a starting mining upgrade he must pay the second cost of two. He pays a silver from his hand, takes a Mining card and places a crew disk on the Mining pile. He will now draw one additional resource when mining successfully for the rest of the game and no one else will be able to upgrade mining this turn.

Susan decides to play it safe after a crash and upgrade Armor. The first Armor only costs one, but the cheapest resource she has is a silver. She decides to pay this, despite not getting change back, takes an Armor card and places a crew disk on the Armor pile. She will add one to her die rolls for the rest of the game and no one else will be able to upgrade mining this turn.

Teresa also decides to upgrade, but Armor and Mining are taken so Crew is her only option. Since she has two starting Crew, she must pay the third cost of four. She pays a gold and a copper together to cover the cost, takes a Crew card and places a crew disk on the Crew pile. She will have this extra crew disk to take actions with for the rest of the game and no one else will be able to upgrade crew this turn.

Morgan will not be able to purchase any upgrades this turn, but is hopeful that he can use resources he gathers this turn to get better upgrades next turn.
